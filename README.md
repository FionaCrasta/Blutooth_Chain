I designed a user-friendly tracker app and accompanying physical tracker using Figma, focusing on seamless Bluetooth pairing, intuitive tracking features, and accessibility. Key design elements include:

Streamlined pairing process: Leveraged UI components in Figma to guide users effortlessly through the initial setup and maintain a reliable connection.
Intuitive proximity indicator: Incorporated a visual representation of the 60-meter connection range, providing users with real-time feedback on their proximity to the tracker.
One-tap ringing: Prioritized quick item retrieval by strategically placing a prominent "Ring" button within the app, enabling users to instantly activate the tracker's sound from their phone.
Accessible design: Implemented clear visual cues, alternative text for icons, and compatibility with screen readers to ensure usability for everyone.
